Create Bank Management System


XYZ banks wants to automate the basic functionality of one branch. The features that need to be 
automated are: 
1. Over the counter activities: 
2. Account lifecycle: 
3. Interest Calculation: 
4. End of day report for daily transactions
   
The bank has different type of accounts: 

1. Savings Account 
2. Salary Account 
3. Current Account 
4. Loan Account
   
A savings account is typically used by an individual for personal usage and it is necessary for the 
account to have an average minimum balance of 10000 rs..

A Salary account is exactly similar to a savings account except that it has a time limit in which at 
least one transaction should have taken place. If no transactions happen on a salary account for 
two months, the account is frozen and the account holder is notified. 

A current account does not have any such facilities or restrictions. The current account allows the 
customer to have an overdraft facility, where the customer will have a maximum limit set that he 
can withdraw over the current balance. 

A loan account can keep track of the amount of loan repaid by a specific customer who has taken a 
loan from the bank. It acts as a standard savings account, but has an initial balance of negative (loan 
amount), and interest is also calculated accordingly.
